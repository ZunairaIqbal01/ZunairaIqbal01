# Welcome to my profile! 👋

Thank you for taking the time to visit my page.

I’m a finance professional with over 9 years of experience across financial controllership, external audit, accounting standards implementation, and group reporting. My background spans IFRS and US GAAP, ERP systems, sustainability-related financial disclosures, and finance process automation.

My ambition is to continuously improve how **financial governance, cash flow discipline, and sustainability reporting** are understood and applied—especially for small and medium-sized businesses that often lack access to high-quality financial tools.

## 🧭 Professional Focus

My work sits at the intersection of:

- Financial governance and internal controls  
- Cash flow sustainability and liquidity risk management  
- Financial reporting under IFRS and US GAAP  
- ERP systems and finance process automation  
- Sustainability accounting (ISSB, IFRS S1 & S2, ESG disclosures)  
- Practical finance tools designed for real-world decision-making  

I focus on **clarity, structure, and decision usefulness**, rather than theoretical complexity.
